## Features

MovieBase is a web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP that provides a user-friendly platform for movie enthusiasts to explore and discover movie information. Key functionalities include:

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out to personalize their experience.
- **Movie Details**: Each movie has a dedicated page displaying information like director, writer, synopsis, and user reviews.
- **Like Toggle**: Users can "like" movies, potentially storing these preferences for future reference.
- **Review Submission**: Users can submit reviews for movies they've watched.
- **User Profiles**: User can view their profiles and their interactions (likes, reviews).
- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by title, and the application fetches details of the searched movie.

Please note that some features (like toggle and review submission) might require further development to be fully functional. This README provides a general overview of the current functionalities.
